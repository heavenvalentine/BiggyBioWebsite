            Plants are one type of living things that live side by side with humans. Plants have many benefits for life. The most basic benefit is as a supplier of oxygen for the life of all living things on earth. Every part of the plant has a function and benefits for life. For example, for food sources, industrial raw materials, health, and so on. The parts of the plant are: Roots Leaves Stems Flowers Fruits

            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
            <strong>Function of Roots</strong>
            <br>
            A plant has roots that grow in the ground. This underground part plays a very important role in pulling the water and minerals so they can reach the plant. Furthermore, it also expands within the ground so that for better water absorption the water increases.
            <br>
            <br>
            Roots also play the role of anchors which helps in creating better stability. In addition, the roots also fuse the development of the plant and stock reserve food material. They also store food that binds the soil together.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Function of Stem</strong>
            <br>
            The stem is the part that stays above the ground. A stem usually bears leaves, fruits plus flowers. It distributes the nutrients and minerals all the way from the plant to the leaves. Furthermore, the stem is the support system of the plant.
            <br>
            <br>
            Moreover, it shields the plant and assists in asexual dissemination. The thorns of a stem protect it from animals as well. The growth of a stem takes place upwards allowing leaves to reach the sunlight for photosynthesis.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong> Function of Leaf </strong>
            <br>
            It is safe to say that a leaf is one of the most important parts of a plant. It contains chlorophyll which assists the plants in preparation for food. Moreover, the veins of a leaf allow the flowing of nutrients plus water.
            <br>
            <br>
            A leaf has three basic parts which are petiole, leaf base and lamina. The leaves of the plant help in photosynthesis. Moreover, they help in removing any excess water via stomata. In short, it is for transpiration.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Function of Flower</strong>
            <br>
            The bright and beautiful part of the plant which you see is the flower. They play a role in making food. A flower has female as well as male parts. Both of these work collectively to fertilize the plant so it can produce seeds.
            <br>
            <br>
            A flower consists of four basic parts, which are petals, sepals, stamens, and pistil. The petals attract insects and birds in order to pollinate them. After that, the flower buds are protected by sepals. Similarly, the stamens which are the male part and the pistil that is the female part help in the reproduction system.
