            </h1>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
            Biology is the science that studies the origin, evolution and characteristics of living things, as well as their vital processes, behavior and interactions with each other and with the environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            Such a word is formed from the Greek roots βίος (bíos), meaning 'life', and -λογία (-logy), meaning 'science' or 'study'.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thus, biology is responsible for describing and explaining the behavior and characteristics that distinguish living things, both as individuals, and as a whole, as a species.

            <h4 class="subtitle-note mt-3 mb-2">The Importance Of Biology
            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
            One of the basic goals of biology is to establish the laws that govern living organisms. That is, it includes the study of the origin of life and its evolution during our existence.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research and studies on living things continuously. This allows us to better understand how complex microorganisms are and how our bodies work.
            <br>
            <br>
            Likewise, scientific research in biology has enabled various specialists to create drugs and vaccines that fight infections or prevent disease to improve the quality of life for all of us, including animals and plants.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, biology is also a science that brings extraordinary knowledge into other branches of scientific study.

            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
            Biology is a broad science from which many branches have emerged that investigate the most diverse aspects related to living organisms, such as:
            <br>
            <br>
            Anatomy: studies the internal and external structures of living things.
            <br>
            Bacteriology: the study of bacteria.
            <br>
            Biomedicine: the study of human health.
            <br>
            Biochemistry: the study of chemical processes.
            <br>
            Ecology: study of organisms and their relationships, even with the environment.
            <br>
            Embryology: studies the development of the embryo.
            <br>
            Entomology: the study of insects.
            <br>
            Ethology: the study of human and animal behavior.
            <br>
            Evolutionary: the study of the changes living things undergo over time.
            <br>
            Phylogeny: the study of how living things evolved.
            <br>
            Genetics: the study of genes.
            <br>
            Histology: the study of tissue composition and structure.
            <br>
            Immunology: the study of the body's mechanisms of combating poisons, antigens, etc.
            <br>
            Mycology: the study of fungi.
            <br>
            Microbiology: the study of microorganisms.
            <br>
            Organography: the study of the organs of animals and plants.
            <br>
            Paleontology: the study of organisms that lived on Earth in the past.
            Taxonomy: the study that makes it possible to classify living things.
            <br>
            Virology: the study of viruses.
            <br>
