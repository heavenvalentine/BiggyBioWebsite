            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
            Ecology studies the distribution, abundance of life, and the interactions between organisms and their environment. The habitat of an organism can be described as a local abiotic factor such as climate, in addition to the presence of other organisms and biotic factors. Biological systems are difficult to study because there are so many possible interactions between organisms and their environment, even on a small scale. Bacteria in the sugar gradient respond to the environment much like a lion searching for food on the African savanna. Any species can also exhibit a variety of behaviors, such as cooperation, aggression, parasitism, or mutualism. The problem becomes even more complicated when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.

            Ecological systems are studied at a number of different levels, from individuals to populations, ecosystems, and the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although the term population biology is more often used when studying disease, viruses, and microbes, while population ecology is more often used when studying plants and animals. Ecology also refers to the various existing subdisciplines.
            Ethology investigates the behavior of animals (especially social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists also study the evolution of behavior and try to understand behavior in the context of natural selection.

            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
            Every living creature such as humans, animals and plants has a close relationship that cannot be separated. This relationship is established naturally and is often referred to as Ecology. In biology subject matter, ecology is the science that studies the interrelationships between living things and their environment. We can find the application of ecology in everyday life. A simple example is the activities carried out by farmers when working on their paddy fields. In this case, farmers will sprinkle compost and other fertilizers so that the rice plants can grow well. So that later the rice will produce fluffier rice which is very delicious to eat. The ecological relationship in the example above involves living things, namely farmers and rice plants. While the environment is in the form of soil, water, nutrients, and so on.

            <h4 class="subtitle-note mt-3 mb-2">Ecological Benefits
            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
            Ecology is the science that deals with ecosystems and the living things in them. Therefore, this branch of biology has benefits and greatly impacts human life.
            <br>
Following are some of the benefits and examples of ecological science in everyday life: 
  <br>
  <br>
1. Knowing biodiversity and recognizing the behavior of living things. 
<br>
2. Knowing the role of humans in their environment. 
<br>
3. Mapping food consumption. 
<br>
4. Knowing and looking for solutions from health problems, agriculture, to the energy sector.
<br>
<br>
Thus the discussion about the definition of ecology to the benefits of ecological science. As a branch of biology, ecology is an effective attempt to find out how the interrelationships between organisms and their environment.
