                The female reproductive system is a group of organs in the female body that are responsible for the production and transportation of eggs (also known as ova), as well as the production of hormones and the support of pregnancy and childbirth. The main organs of the female reproductive system include the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the vagina.
                <br><br>
                The ovaries are a pair of small, almond-shaped organs that are located in the lower abdomen, on either side of the uterus. The ovaries produce eggs and hormones, including estrogen and progesterone.
                <br><br>
                The fallopian tubes are a pair of tubes that extend from the uterus to the ovaries. The eggs are released from the ovaries and travel through the fallopian tubes to the uterus.
                <br><br>
                The uterus, also known as the womb, is a muscular, pear-shaped organ that is located in the pelvis. The uterus is where a fertilized egg implants and grows into a baby during pregnancy.
                <br><br>
                The vagina is a muscular tube that connects the uterus to the outside of the body. The vagina is also known as the birth canal, as it is through the vagina that a baby is born during childbirth.
                <br><br>
                The female reproductive system also includes the vulva, which is the external genital area that includes the clitoris, the labia, and the vaginal opening.

                The female reproductive anatomy includes both external and internal parts.

            <h4 class="subtitle-note mt-3 mb-2">External parts
            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
                The function of your external genitals are to protect the internal parts from infection and allow sperm to enter your vagina.
                <br>
                Your vulva is the collective name for all your external genitals. A lot of people mistakenly use the term “vagina” to describe all female reproductive parts. However, your vagina is its own structure located inside your body.
                <br>
                The main parts of your vulva or external genitals are:
                <ul>
                <li>Labia majora: Your labia majora (“large lips”) enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. During puberty, hair growth occurs on the skin of the labia majora, which also contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.</li>
                <li>Labia minora: Your labia minora (“small lips”) can have a variety of sizes and shapes. They lie just inside your labia majora, and surround the opening to your vagina (the canal that joins the lower part of your uterus to the outside of your body) and urethra (the tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body). This skin is very delicate and can become easily irritated and swollen.</li>
                <li>Clitoris: Your two labia minora meet at your clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that’s comparable to a penis in men or people assigned male at birth (AMAB). Your clitoris is covered by a fold of skin called the prepuce and is very sensitive to stimulation.</li>
                <li>Vaginal opening: Your vaginal opening allows menstrual blood and babies to exit your body. Tampons, fingers, sex toys or penises can go inside your vagina through your vaginal opening.</li>
                <li>Hymen: Your hymen is a piece of tissue covering or surrounding part of your vaginal opening. It’s formed during development and present during birth.</li>
                <li>Opening to your urethra: The opening to your urethra is the hole you pee from.</li>
                </ul>
	        </p>

            <h4 class="subtitle-note mt-3 mb-2">Internal parts
            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
                <ul>
                <li>Vagina: Your vagina is a muscular canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of uterus) to the outside of the body. It can widen to accommodate a baby during delivery and then shrink back to hold something narrow like a tampon. It’s lined with mucous membranes that help keep it moist.</li>
                <li>Cervix: Your cervix is the lowest part of your uterus. A hole in the middle allows sperm to enter and menstrual blood to exit. Your cervix opens (dilates) to allow a baby to come out during a vaginal childbirth. Your cervix is what prevents things like tampons from getting lost inside your body.</li>
                <li>Uterus: Your uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that holds a fetus during pregnancy. Your uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix and the corpus. Your corpus is the larger part of your uterus that expands during pregnancy.</li>
                <li>Ovaries: Ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of your uterus. Your ovaries produce eggs and hormones.</li>
                <li>Fallopian tubes: These are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of your uterus and serve as pathways for your egg (ovum) to travel from your ovaries to your uterus. Fertilization of an egg by sperm normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants into your uterine lining.</li>
                </ul>
