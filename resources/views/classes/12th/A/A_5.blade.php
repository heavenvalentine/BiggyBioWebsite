            </h1>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">
                Anabolism is the process by which the body utilizes the energy released by catabolism to synthesize complex molecules. These complex molecules are then utilized to form cellular structures that are formed from small and simple precursors that act as building blocks.
                <br><br>
                Anabolism is the metabolic process that involves the synthesis of complex biomolecules from simpler precursors. Anabolism is typically fueled by the energy stored in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecules, which are produced through the process of catabolism. Anabolism plays a number of important roles in living organisms, including:
                <ol>
                <li>Growth and development: Anabolism is essential for the growth and development of cells and tissues.</li>

                <li>Repair and maintenance: Anabolism is involved in the repair and maintenance of tissues and organs.</li>

                <li>Energy storage: Some biomolecules, such as glycogen and fat, can be stored in the body and used as a source of energy when needed. Anabolism is involved in the synthesis of these energy-rich molecules.</li>

                <li>Metabolism of nutrients: Anabolism is also involved in the metabolism of nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.</li>

                <li>Hormone synthesis: Anabolism is involved in the synthesis of hormones, which are chemical messengers that regulate various physiological processes in the body.</li>
                </ol>
                Anabolism is regulated by various enzymes, hormones, and other signaling molecules, and it is essential for the proper functioning of cells and tissues. However, anabolism also requires energy, and cells must balance their energy needs with the energy they have available to ensure they have enough energy to sustain their functions.

                Condensation reactions occur when monomers are covalently joined and water is produced as a by-product

                Monosaccharides are joined via glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides and polysaccharides
                Amino acids are joined via peptide bonds to make polypeptide chains
                Glycerol and fatty acids are joined via an ester linkage to create triglycerides
                Nucleotides are joined by phosphodiester bonds to form polynucleotide chains

                The breakdown of organic molecules via catabolism typically occurs via hydrolysis reactions
                <br><br>
                Hydrolysis reactions require the consumption of water molecules to break the bonds within the polymer

            </h4>

            <h4 class="subtitle-note mt-3 mb-2">Protein Synthesis
            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">

                Proteins are macromolecules that carry out cellular activities encoded by an organism’s genes. They have many different functions in the body, including DNA replication, aiding chemical reactions (as enzymes), transporting materials in the cell, cell growth and signaling, and providing physical structure. Each cell in the human body contains about 1 to 3 billion proteins.
                <br><br>
                Proteins are synthesized from smaller molecules called amino acids in a cell’s ribosomes. Each protein is a chain of a specific sequence of amino acids. Since proteins are larger molecules put together from smaller ones, the process of protein synthesis is anabolic.

            <h4 class="subtitle-note mt-3 mb-2"> DNA Synthesis
            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">

                Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is an organism’s genetic material. It is macromolecule made up of smaller molecules called nucleic acids, which are themselves made up of a nucleotide base attached to a deoxyribose sugar and a phosphate molecule. DNA synthesis is an anabolic process that takes place in a cell’s nucleus just before the cell divides. It involves unzipping the double strands of DNA and attaching new matching nucleotides to each half of the strand that has been unzipped, forming two new strands that each contain half of the old DNA strand.

            <h4 class="subtitle-note mt-3 mb-2"> Growth of Bones and Muscles
            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">

                On a larger scale, the growth of body parts such as bones and muscles is anabolic. Bone growth, or ossification, occurs when bone is formed from cells called osteoclasts. It is then mineralized through cells called osteoblasts. This process is also anabolic; during mineralization, osteoblasts produce calcium phosphate crystals that are incorporated into the bone’s structure, making the bones hard and sturdy.
                <br><br>
                Muscle growth, also called muscle hypertrophy, occurs when the cells of skeletal muscles, called myocytes, increase in size. It occurs through strength training exercises such as lifting weights. Factors like sex, age, and diet all affect hypertrophy. During hypertrophy, there is increased protein synthesis of actin and myosin, and the volume of sarcoplasmic fluid in the myocyte increases.

            <h4 class="subtitle-note mt-3 mb-2">Anabolic Steroids
            </h4>
            <p class="desc-note mt-2">

                Anabolic steroids are androgenic hormones that are natural (e.g. testosterone) or produced synthetically and mimic the effects of testosterone. Androgens are anabolic; they increase protein within muscle cells, which causes an increase in muscle mass. Anabolic steroids are used to treat certain medical conditions like delayed puberty in boys, and they can also be used for muscle growth, to stimulate the appetite, to produce secondary sex characteristics in transgender males, and to help treat certain conditions that may cause a loss in muscle mass, such as cancer and AIDS.
                <br><br>
                However, sometimes anabolic steroids are also abused by athletes who want to quickly gain more muscle. Most major sports organizations ban doping, the use of anabolic steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs, in order to discourage steroid abuse. Although using steroids can increase muscle mass, it also has many adverse side effects. These range from acne to high blood pressure to aggression (“’roid rage”), and even psychosis. Steroids can affect the structure of the heart, which could lead to congestive heart failure or a heart attack. They also have adverse effects on cholesterol levels, may stunt height, and can lead to liver damage in high doses.
