# BiggyBioWebsite
 Our Mobile Web Development project resulted in "Biggy Bio," a website designed to assist junior and senior high school students in their biology studies. Using PHP, MYSQL, HTML, CSS, and the Laravel Framework, we crafted a user-friendly platform that offers an interactive and enjoyable way for teens to learn about biology.
